## Overview

We are creating an application to track studios, movies, and actors

* Studios have a name and location
    * ex. name: 'Universal Studios', location: 'Hollywood'
* Movies have a title, creation year, and genre
    * ex. title: 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', creation_year: 1981, genre: 'Action/Adventure'
* Actors have a name and age
    * name: 'Harrison Ford', age: 78
* Studios have many Movies
* Movies belong to a Studio
* Movies have many Actors
* Actors can be in many Movies

Some of the initial migrations have been done for you.

Story 3
Add an Actor to a Movie

As a user,
When I visit a movie show page,
I do not see any actors listed that are not part of the movie
And I see a form to add an actor to this movie
When I fill in the form with the name of an actor that exists in the database
And I click submit
Then I am redirected back to that movie's show page
And I see the actor's name is now listed
(You do not have to test for a sad path, for example if the name submitted is not an existing actor)
